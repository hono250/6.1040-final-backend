Maya recently bought a bag full of ingredients for a beef and potatoes recipe that she really wants to follow. Unfortunately, the potatoes only came in 3 lb bags, and she only needed half of them. She wants to use the rest of the potatoes for something before it goes bad. She decides to use the Cooked! app, where she has been saving her recipes from [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), and [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/). She adds in that she wants to use potatoes and carrots from another day to cook and the app shows recipes ranked by the amount of ingredients that she input in and recipes that she personally added to her library. Maya selects a potato curry with carrots recipe that she saw on Instagram from a year ago, but never got around to using it. Maya is happy that she can see all her saved recipes from all across the Internet in one place and reduces her food waste by using up the rest of her potatoes and carrots.
