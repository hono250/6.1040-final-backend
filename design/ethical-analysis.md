# Ethical Analysis

## Insights

### 1. Indirect Stakeholders - Recipe Creators

**Observation:** Saving recipes from other apps may discredit recipe creators off of the app, if the recipes are being shared on our app. This can even lead to material loss for recipe content creators.

**Design Response:** Rather than translating recipes entirely into our app (bypassing the original content), link to the original content and only extrapolate base information (like ingredients, recipe name), as well as the creator to provide attribution.

### 2. Time: Adaptation and Lifestyle Changes

**Observation:** The app could support positive lifestyle changes (cooking more, reducing waste) but might indirectly encourage negative behaviours such as obsessing over ingredient tracking that creates stress instead of reducing it.

**Design Response:** Avoid guilt inducing language about waste. Include features that celebrate using ingredients (cooking streaks, recipes completed) instead of shaming users for expired ingredients. Maybe make ingredient tracking optional.

### 3. Pervasiveness: Macro Economic Uncertainty

**Observation:** [In recent years the cost of groceries has increased faster than inflation](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings) which makes food waste more costly than it may have been in previous years.

**Design Response:** Emphasize savings associated with avoiding food waste. This could look like adding ingredient cost awareness into our recommendation algorithm.

### 4. Time: Sustained Friendships

**Observation:** Cooking and recipes often create and follow strong interpersonal bonds. This can be seen in multi-generational family recipes, the sharing of food between friends, etc.

**Design Response:** To emphasize the social/interpersonal aspect, we could allow users to join groups to share recipes in, or add support for joint ingredient consideration.

### 5. Stakeholders: Variation in Human Ability

**Observation:** Someone who needs to use many substitutions (due to allergens, religious beliefs, vegan/vegetarianism, etc) may not be able to find recipes based on their ingredients if substitutions are not considered by the system.

**Design Response:** Allow users to specify substitutions, and consider substitutions when performing ingredient-matching.

### 6. Value: Cooking Autonomy for Direct Stakeholders

**Observation:** Sometimes, there might be an illusion of autonomy in cooking because [stakeholders need the right ingredients and knowledge for what food is healthy](https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/yGCRBBcKMsh39nHc8yMQtrJ/?format=pdf&lang=en). The actual cooking might also require a higher cooking skill or interest.

**Design Response:** The feature to allow cooks to add in their own recipes contributes to their autonomy because it's something they have already decided to save. It would be helpful to categorize recipes by their difficulty and what meal time it's for (main dish vs snack) so that beginners feel less friction and aren't overwhelmed by what they need to do.
