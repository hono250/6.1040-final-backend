A table showing which features you expect to deliver at various stages, including at least the two checkpoints; an assignment of responsibilities to team members; a discussion of the key risks you face and how you will mitigate them (and your fallback option will be if something turns out to be unimplementable).

## Key Risks and Changes

Our primary risk is time and scope. There is a chance that we will be unable to implement all of our features by the deadline, especially if unexpected difficulties arise. As such, we have divided our features into core features and additional features. Core features are the minimum set of features that are necessary to be implemented for our app to fulfill its purpose. These are all planned to be submitted by the alpha deadline. If any delays occur, then we should be able to push back the schedule and have them submitted by the beta deadline, at the expense of an additional feature. 

Another risk that we're encountering is the feasibility of automating the import recipe process from other platforms. If analyzing external posts/videos for ingreidents/recipe names is infeasible, then we plan to fall back on requiring manual importing of the data.
