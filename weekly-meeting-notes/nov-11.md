# Meeting: November 11, 2025

### Team members present: Ryan, Honorine, Eyob, Christine

### Agenda

N/A — This first week served primarily as an introductory meeting and discussion rather than a structured agenda-driven session.

---

### Progress Report

N/A — This was the first meeting; no prior progress to report.

---

### Design Changes

N/A — No design changes have been made yet.

### Issues

- The **problem framing assignment** is worded vaguely, making it difficult to know how to structure our responses. _Discussed Solution:_ We should ask clarifying questions on Piazza to get feedback directly from Daniel as he is a source of truth.
- There is some uncertainty around how to **select and justify features**. _Discussed Solution:_ We need to focus on features that present something new while still reusing essential components.
- Clarification needed on how much to rely on **comparables**. _Discussed Solution:_ Use comparables as problem validation rather than a place to select missing features from other apps and websites.

### Plans & Decisions

- Meeting on to discuss pitch/next assignment Wed. 12, 2025 after lecture
- Will focus on 4-5 concepts in our final solution
- Focus on food waste as the problem rather than recipe organization.
- Complete and polish problem framing assignment

---

### Additional Notes

- Other groups are tackling **one domain, one problem** so we can do the same.
- Comparables are meant to showcase that others try to solve the problem/problems adjacent to ours
